# Automated Chocolate Detection and Sorting System

## Project Overview
An intelligent system that combines computer vision and robotics to automatically detect and sort different types of chocolate bars. The system uses YOLO object detection and can interface with a robotic arm for sorting operations.

## Features
- Real-time chocolate detection using YOLO
- Support for 4 chocolate types:
  - Cadbury Chocolate
  - KitKat Chocolate
  - Mars Chocolate
  - Snickers Chocolate
- Professional interface with FPS monitoring
- Detection zone visualization
- Integration capability with robotic arm
- High-performance image processing

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- Webcam/USB Camera
- Robotic Arm (optional for sorting)
- Computer with minimum specifications:
  - RAM: 4GB (8GB recommended)
  - Processor: Intel i5 or equivalent
  - GPU: Optional but recommended

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO
- cvzone
- NumPy
- PySerial (for robotic arm integration)
